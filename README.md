# self-supervised-learning

Over the past decade, researchers have applied supervised learning algorithms to identify image features and classify images. However, in order to successfully learn image features, the networks usually require a vast amount of manually labeled data. Labeling huge sets of data is expensive and impractical to scale. Self-supervised methods solve the problem of requiring huge labeled datasets. In this project, we explored two self-supervised frameworks: SimCLR and RotNet. We made some adjustments and were able to achieve 54\% classification accuracy with SimCLR and 63\% classification accuracy with RotNet. The results were lower than the supervised learning model and the results from the paper as we made simplifications and adjustments with limited resources.
